				<h6>Welcome to Farm Boy</h6>
					<p>Farm Boy specializes in quality produce, deli, cheese,
meats, dairy and bakery products that are farm fresh and bursting with down home goodness. </p>

					<p>The Farm Boy stores are also well known for creating a fun shopping experience, with well trained staff and unique	 animated characters that entertain both children and adults alike. Shoppers may be greeted by a singing Farm Boy and his dog Barndoor Buddy, a mischievous	 monkey who does endless flips over the banana display, or Lulu the cow who keeps watch over the dairy section!</p>

					<p>Bring the whole family to Farm Boy today, or read on and learn about how we deliver a fun, fresh experience	 for all. Either way, we're glad you stopped by, and we look forward to serving you soon!</p>

				<h6>The Farm Boy Story</h6>
					<p>In December 1981, Jean-Louis and Colette Bellemare opened the first Farm Boy on Cumberland Street in Cornwall,	 Ontario. At that time, the modest 300 sq. ft. store sold only produce. The second Farm Boy was opened in	 February 1983 by brother Normand Bellemare in Cornwall. The store continued to grow and eventually expanded	 its product lines to include deli, bread, and dairy products.</p>

			<h6>The Farm Boy Difference</h6>
				<p>Farm Boy offers a unique and different shopping experience from the big box retailers or traditional grocers with	 tens of thousands of dry good products on endless rows of shelves. We prefer our food fresh, and our dedicated	 employees have worked hard to create a unique environment where you can get farm fresh food for your family.</p>
